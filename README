XQuery utility to convert MARC/XML Authority records to MADS/RDF and SKOS resources.

ml.xqy - can be used with the MarkLogic Database and Application Server (http://community.marklogic.com/docs).  This expects an HTTP application server.  Set up an application server with the location of this package as the root and (purely as an example) go to 
	http://hostname:port/ml.xqy?marcxmluri=http://location/of/marcxml.xml&model=both&baseuri=http://base-uri/

saxon.xqy can be used with the Saxon XSLT and Xquery Processoer.  This has been tested using the Saxon processor in Eclipse and Oxygen.  Saxon can be run from the command line or through either of the two previously mentioned applications.  For more about Saxon see http://saxon.sourceforge.net/  

zorba.xqy can be used with the Zorba Xquery processor.  Added 30 November 2012.  For more about see http://www.zorba-xquery.com/  Run from the command line with:

	zorba -i -q file:///location/of/zorba.xqy -e marcxmluri:="../location/of/marcxml.xml" -e model:="all" -e baseuri:="http://base/"
